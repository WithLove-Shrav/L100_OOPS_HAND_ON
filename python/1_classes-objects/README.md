# Classes & Objects in Python

This folder provides a clear, beginner‑friendly introduction to **classes** and **objects** in Python, mirroring the concepts you’ve seen in Java and TypeScript but using Python’s dynamic and concise syntax.

## What you’ll find
- `customer.py` – a simple class that defines attributes, an `__init__` constructor, and a `__str__` method for readable output.
- Example scripts that instantiate `Customer` objects, demonstrate attribute access, and show how methods operate on instance data.

## Key concepts covered
1. **Class definition** – using the `class` keyword.
2. **Instance attributes** – created in `__init__`.
3. **Methods** – regular functions that receive `self`.
4. **Special methods** – `__str__`, `__repr__`, and others for Pythonic behavior.
5. **Object creation** – calling the class like a function.

## How to explore
```bash
# Run the example directly (no compilation needed)
python customer.py
```
Feel free to add more attributes, methods, or create additional classes to experiment with inheritance, composition, and other OOP principles.
