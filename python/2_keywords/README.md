# Keywords in Python

This folder contains concise examples that illustrate **Python keywords**—the reserved words that have special meaning in the language and cannot be used as identifiers.

## What you’ll find
- Small scripts demonstrating control‑flow keywords such as `if`, `elif`, `else`, and `match` (Python 3.10+).
- Looping keywords: `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, and `else` on loops.
- Definition and import keywords: `def`, `class`, `import`, `from`, `as`, `global`, `nonlocal`.
- Miscellaneous keywords: `pass`, `raise`, `assert`, `lambda`, `with`, `yield`, `async`, `await`.

## How to explore
1. Open any `.py` file in this directory.
2. Run the script with the Python interpreter to see the keyword in action.

```bash
python example.py
```

Feel free to modify the examples to experiment with different keyword combinations and observe how they affect program flow.
