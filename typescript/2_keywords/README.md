# Keywords in TypeScript

This folder contains examples that illustrate **TypeScript keywords** and their usage. Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in the language and cannot be used as identifiers.

## What you’ll find
- Sample snippets demonstrating control flow (`if`, `else`, `switch`), loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`), and other fundamental keywords (`let`, `const`, `enum`, `type`, `interface`).
- Small programs that show how these keywords affect program behavior.

## How to explore
1. Open any `.ts` file in this directory.
2. Read the comments that explain the purpose of each keyword.
3. Run the examples with `ts-node` or compile with `tsc`.

```bash
# Run directly (requires ts-node)
npx ts-node example.ts
# Or compile then run
npx tsc example.ts
node example.js
```

Feel free to modify the examples to experiment with different keywords.
