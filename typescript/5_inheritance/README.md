# Inheritance in TypeScript

This folder demonstrates **inheritance** in TypeScript, where a class can extend another class to reuse and augment its behavior.

## What you’ll find
- A base class defining common properties and methods.
- Subclasses that extend the base class and override or add functionality.
- Example code showing how objects of subclasses can be used wherever a base class is expected.

## How to explore
1. Open the `.ts` files to see the class hierarchy.
2. Run the example with `ts-node` or compile with `tsc`.

```bash
# Run directly (requires ts-node)
npx ts-node main.ts
# Or compile then run
npx tsc *.ts
node main.js
```

Feel free to create additional subclasses or modify existing ones to experiment with deeper inheritance trees.
