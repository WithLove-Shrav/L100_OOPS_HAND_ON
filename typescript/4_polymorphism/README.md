# Polymorphism in TypeScript

This folder showcases **polymorphism** in TypeScript, demonstrating how a single interface or base class can be used to represent multiple underlying implementations.

## What you’ll find
- Interfaces with several concrete classes implementing them.
- Example of method overriding and dynamic dispatch.
- A `main.ts` (or similar) that creates instances of different classes and calls the same method to illustrate polymorphic behavior.

## How to explore
1. Open the `.ts` files to see the interface and class definitions.
2. Run the example with `ts-node` or compile with `tsc`.

```bash
# Run directly (requires ts-node)
npx ts-node main.ts
# Or compile then run
npx tsc *.ts
node main.js
```

Feel free to add more implementations or experiment with abstract classes to deepen your understanding of polymorphism.
