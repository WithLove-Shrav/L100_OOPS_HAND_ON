# Classes & Objects in TypeScript

This folder demonstrates **classes** and **objects** in TypeScript, mirroring Java's OOP concepts but with TypeScript’s syntax and type system.

## What you’ll find
- `Pastry.ts` – a simple class with properties, a constructor, and a method.
- Example usage showing how to instantiate objects and access their members.

## How to explore
1. Open the `.ts` files and read the inline comments.
2. Compile with `tsc` (or run directly with `ts-node`).

```bash
# Compile
npx tsc Pastry.ts
# Run (if you have a main file)
node Pastry.js
```

Feel free to add more properties, methods, or create additional classes to experiment with inheritance and interfaces.
