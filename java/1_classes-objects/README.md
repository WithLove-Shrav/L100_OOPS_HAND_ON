# Java Classes & Objects Example

This directory contains a basic example that demonstrates **classes** and **objects** in Java, a fundamental concept of Object‑Oriented Programming (OOP).

## What you’ll find
- **`Customer.java`** – a simple class representing a customer with a name and an ID.
- (Other supporting files may be added later.)

## How it works
1. The `Customer` class defines fields, a constructor, and a `toString` method.
2. You can create instances (objects) of `Customer` in a `main` method or another class.
3. The example shows how to set and retrieve data using getters/setters (if added) and how objects interact.

## Running the example
```bash
# Compile the Java file(s)
javac Customer.java

# Run (if a Main class is present)
java Main
```

Feel free to modify the class, add more fields, methods, or create additional classes to explore inheritance, encapsulation, and other OOP principles.
