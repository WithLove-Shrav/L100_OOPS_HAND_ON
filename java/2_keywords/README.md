# Keywords in Java

This folder contains examples that illustrate **Java keywords** and their usage. Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in the language and cannot be used as identifiers.

## What you’ll find
- Sample code snippets demonstrating control flow (`if`, `else`, `switch`), loops (`for`, `while`, `do`), and other fundamental keywords (`static`, `final`, `return`).
- Small programs that show how these keywords affect program behavior.

## How to explore
1. Open any `.java` file in this directory.
2. Read the comments that explain the purpose of each keyword.
3. Compile and run the examples to see the keywords in action.

```bash
javac Example.java
java Example
```

Feel free to modify the examples to experiment with different keywords.
