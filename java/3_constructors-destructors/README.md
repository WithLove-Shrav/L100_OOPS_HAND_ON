# Constructors & Destructors in Java

This directory demonstrates how **constructors** are used to initialize objects in Java. Java does not have explicit destructors; instead, it relies on garbage collection.

## What you’ll find
- Example classes with parameterless and parameterized constructors.
- Code showing constructor chaining using `this()`.
- Discussion of the `finalize()` method (deprecated) and why explicit destructors are unnecessary.

## How to explore
1. Open the `.java` files to see constructor definitions.
2. Compile and run any `Main` class to observe object creation.

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

Feel free to add your own constructors to experiment with different initialization patterns.
