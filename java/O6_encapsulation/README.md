# Encapsulation in Java

This folder contains examples that illustrate **encapsulation**, the principle of bundling data (fields) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class) and restricting direct access from outside the class.

## What you’ll find
- Classes with `private` fields and `public` getter/setter methods.
- Demonstrations of how encapsulation protects internal state and enforces invariants.
- Example usage showing how other classes interact with encapsulated objects via their public API.

## How to explore
1. Open the `.java` files to see the encapsulated class definitions.
2. Compile and run any provided `Main` class to observe encapsulation in action.

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

Feel free to experiment by adding validation logic to setters or exposing additional methods.
