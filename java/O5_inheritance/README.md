# Inheritance in Java

This folder demonstrates **inheritance**, the mechanism by which a new class (subclass) can acquire the properties and behaviors of an existing class (superclass).

## What you’ll find
- Base classes defining common fields and methods.
- Subclasses that extend the base class and override or add functionality.
- Example programs showing how objects of subclasses can be used wherever a superclass is expected.

## How to explore
1. Open the `.java` files to see the class hierarchy.
2. Compile and run the provided `Main` class to observe inheritance in action.

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

Feel free to create additional subclasses or modify existing ones to experiment with deeper inheritance trees.
