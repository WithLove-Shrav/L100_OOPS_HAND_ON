# Other OOP Concepts in Java

This folder contains examples of **additional OOP concepts** that complement classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Topics covered
- **Interfaces** – defining contracts that classes can implement.
- **Abstract classes** – partially implemented base classes.
- **Packages** – organizing classes into namespaces.
- **Static members** – class‑level fields and methods.
- **Enums** – type‑safe enumerations.

## How to explore
1. Open any `.java` file to see the concept in action.
2. Compile and run the provided `Main` class (if present) to observe behavior.

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

Feel free to modify the examples to deepen your understanding of these concepts.
