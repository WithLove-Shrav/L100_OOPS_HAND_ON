# Abstraction in Java

This folder demonstrates **abstraction**, the concept of exposing only essential features of an object while hiding the complex implementation details.

## What you’ll find
- Abstract classes that define abstract methods without implementation.
- Concrete subclasses that provide specific implementations for those abstract methods.
- Example programs showing how you can work with abstract types without needing to know the underlying details.

## How to explore
1. Open the `.java` files to see the abstract class definitions and their concrete subclasses.
2. Compile and run the provided `Main` class to observe abstraction in action.

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

Feel free to add new abstract methods or create additional subclasses to experiment with different levels of abstraction.
