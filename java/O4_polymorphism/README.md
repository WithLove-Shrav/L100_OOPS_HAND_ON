# Polymorphism in Java

This folder showcases **polymorphism**, the ability of a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). It includes examples of method overriding, dynamic method dispatch, and the use of abstract classes and interfaces to achieve polymorphic behavior.

## What you’ll find
- Example classes that extend a base class and override methods.
- Interfaces with multiple implementations.
- A `Main` class that demonstrates runtime polymorphism.

## How to explore
1. Open the `.java` files to see the class hierarchy.
2. Compile and run the `Main` program to observe polymorphic calls.

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

Feel free to add new subclasses or implementations to experiment with different polymorphic scenarios.
